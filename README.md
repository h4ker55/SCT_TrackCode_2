# Image Encrypt/Decrypt

A simple Python GUI application to encrypt and decrypt images using XOR encryption.

## Features

- Encrypt any image file with a simple XOR key
- Decrypt previously encrypted images
- Easy-to-use graphical interface (Tkinter)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   Download the code or clone this repository to your computer.

2. **Install Python**

   Make sure Python 3 is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Run the Application**

   Open a terminal (Command Prompt) and navigate to the folder containing `image encyptaion.py`. Then run:

   ```sh
   python "image encyptaion.py"
   ```

4. **Encrypt or Decrypt Images**

   - Click "Encrypt Image" to select and encrypt an image.
   - Click "Decrypt Image" to select and decrypt an image encrypted by this tool.

## Notes

- The encryption uses a simple XOR method with a fixed key (`123`). Do not use for sensitive or secure encryption needs.
- The original image file is overwritten. Make a backup if needed.
